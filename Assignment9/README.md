### The pipelined processor does not function efficiently if it is stalled on every hazard. Use the ideas discussed in class to overcome data hazards in your processor simulation. (Ignore branch hazards).

### Compare the performance (in clock cycles) of the two processors simulated in Assignments 8 and 9.
