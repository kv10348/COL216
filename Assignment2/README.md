## Tic-Tac-Toe game using Qtspim

### Problem 

Write a MIPS Assembly Program to emulate a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, also called noughts and crosses.
It is a two-player game, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player
who succeeds in placing three of their marks in horizontal, vertical or diagonal row is the winner.
The game can also return in a tie.

### Input

Your program should take player inputs from the console and take the decision based on the inputs
from both the players. The code should check if the input is a valid input after each turn.

### Output

The program should print the final board and the outcome (Winner or Tie).
You would be using IO from the console in this assignment. Please refer to this example code
to get familiar with MIPS IO.
