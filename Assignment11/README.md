### Floating Point Addition

In this assignment you will do a software implementation of the Floating Point Adder whose
algorithm was covered in class, and is outlined in Figure 3.14 (Page 205 of the textbook).
Assume that each of the boxes numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4 require one clock cycle, and the
condition checks require zero time. 

#### Inputs 
to the program will be:
1. A text file with each line containing a pair of floating point numbers to be added, in binary
representation (a string of ‘0’ and ‘1’ characters in the file). See sample below.

#### Outputs 
from the program will be:
1. A sequence of addition results, each line containing one result (a string of ‘0’ and ‘1’
characters) and the number of clock cycles required for performing the addition

#### Deliverables:
1. Software implementation of the floating point adder referred to above.
2. Test files used to verify your program. Remember to test for special cases such as
Overflow, Underflow, Normalised result, etc.
3. A document explaining the different test cases.
